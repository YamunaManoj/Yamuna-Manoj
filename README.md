I love diving into data to uncover its secrets – it's like solving puzzles every day! With skills in Tableau, PowerBI, SQL, Python and Excel, I'm like a detective, piecing together the story behind the numbers. And when I share my findings, it's like storytelling – turning data into tales that everyone can understand and enjoy!
